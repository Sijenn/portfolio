            <ul>
              <li>2010-2013 Nyakiambi Girls</li>
              <li>2015-2018 University of Nairobi</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In university I persued a degree in Bachelor of Arts. During
              my four years in <a href="https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/">University</a>
              up to now, I have been doing academic writing and immedietly I completed
              my degree, I started my teaching job in <a href="http://barichohighschool.sc.ke/">Baricho Boys High
                School</a>,
              alongside my academic writing,which I later quit after i wasnt
              satisfied with how i was spending my time.</p>

            <p>I learnt about programming through my cousin when created an
              application which is very much helpful to the community.I immedietly grew interests to learn
              it because I was so impressed to learn that its actually people
              who create applications(I had no idea who or what creates the application)
              through communicating with computers by giving them commands (sounded like magic to me.)
              I applied for the prep classes in Moringa and am looking forward to join
              the <span class="ed">core program</span> and ill later do masters in programming.</p>
