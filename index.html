              </p>
              <p>In university I persued a degree in Bachelor of Arts. During my four years in <a href="https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/">University</a>
                up to now, I have been doing academic writing and immedietly I completed
                my degree, I started my teaching job in <a href="http://barichohighschool.sc.ke/">Baricho Boys High School</a>,
                alongside my academic writing,which I later quit after i wasnt
                satisfied with what i was getting.</p>

              <p>I learnt about programming through my cousin when created an
                application which is very much helpful to the community.I immedietly grew interests to learn
                it because I was so impressed to learn that its actually people
                who create applications(I had no idea who or what creates the application)
                by communicating with computers by giving them commands (sounded like magic to me.)
                I applied for the prep classes in Moringa and am looking forward to join
                the core program and ill later do masters in programming.</p>
