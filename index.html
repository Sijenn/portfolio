            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Am Jenniffer, currently living in Nairobi. I recenty graduated from the
              University of Nairobi and am currently in <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> where am polishing my coding skills. </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <div class="Education">
              <ul>
                <li>2010-2013 Nyakiambi Girls</li>
                <li>2015-2018 University of Nairobi</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>In university I persued a degree in Bachelor of Arts. During my four years in <a href="https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/">University</a>
                up to now, I have been doing academic writing and immedietly I completed
                my degree, I started my teaching job in <a href="http://barichohighschool.sc.ke/">Baricho Boys High School</a>,
                alongside my academic writing,which I later quit after i wasnt
                satisfied with what i was getting.</p>

              <p>During my time in Baricho Boys, i realized teaching wasnt what i really
                wanted because every new day ended just like every other day, nothing was
                changing, I wasnt growing mentally and also financially. I learnt about
                programming through my cousin when he created an application which is very
                much helpful to the society.<br> I immedietly grew interests to learn
                programming because I was so impressed to learn that its actually people
                who create applications(I had no idea who or what creates the application)
                by communicating with computers by giving them commands (sounded like magic to me.)
                I applied for the prep classes in Moringa and am looking forward to join
                the core program and ill later do
                masters in programming.</p>
