              <ul>
                <li>2010-2013 Nyakiambi Girls</li>
                <li>2015-2018 University of Nairobi</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>In university I persued a degree in Bachelor of Arts. During
                my four years in <a href="https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/">University</a>
                up to now, I have been doing academic writing and immedietly I completed
                my degree, I started my teaching job in <a href="http://barichohighschool.sc.ke/">Baricho Boys High School</a>,
                alongside my academic writing,which I later quit after i wasnt
                satisfied with how i was spending my time.</p>

              <p>I learnt about programming through my cousin when created an
                application which is very much helpful to the community.I immedietly grew interests to learn
                it because I was so impressed to learn that its actually people
                who create applications(I had no idea who or what creates the application)
                through communicating with computers by giving them commands (sounded like magic to me.)
                I applied for the prep classes in Moringa and am looking forward to join
                the <span class="ed">core program</span> and ill later do masters in programming.</p>
