  <div class="education">
    <p>Am Jenniffer, currently living in Nairobi. About my education background;
      <ul>
        <li>2010-2013 Nyakiambi High School</li>
        <li>2015-2018 Universityof Nairobi</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In university i persued a degree in Bachelor of Arts. During my four years in
      University up to now, I have been doing academic writing and immedietly I completed
      my degree, I started my teaching job in Baricho Boys High School,
      alongside my academic writing,which I later quit after i wasnt
      satisfied with what i was getting.</p>

    <p>During my time in Baricho Boys, i realized teaching wasnt what i really
      wanted because every new day ended just like every other day, nothing was
      changing, I wasnt growing mentally and also financially. I learnt about
      programming through my cousin when he created an application which is very
      much helpful to the society.<br> I immedietly grew interests to learn
      programming because I was so impressed to learn that its actually people
      who create applications(I had no idea who or what creates the application)
      by communicating with computers by giving them commands (sounded like magic to me.)
      I applied for the prep classes in Moringa and am looking forward to join
      the core program and ill later do
      masters in programming.</p>
